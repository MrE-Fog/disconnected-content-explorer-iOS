# DICE

#### Disconnected Interactive Content Explorer ####

Disconnected Interactive Content Explorer (DICE) is an app for iOS, Android, and Windows that allows users to load interactive content generated in HTML, CSS, and Javascript to a mobile device so the device can display interactive content without a network connection.

DICE can be used by disaster response personnel, urban search-and-rescue teams, and others that need interactive content to assist with their tasks but the cell towers may be down.  No content is included in the app.  It must be loaded.  The app merely is a container that can parse and display interactive content in a web browser on a disconnected device.

The DICE App was developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with [BIT Systems](https://www.bit-sys.com/index.jsp). The government has "unlimited rights" and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions. The software use, modification, and distribution rights are stipulated within the [MIT license](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).

### Content
You can add new content to the app by copying a URL to a DICE report, and then opening the app. A prompt will be shown asking if you would like to download the report.

If you have a lot of content to load, you can plug the device into a computer and open iTunes, select DICE in File Sharing and drag and drop the zips into the DICE Documents list.

Content can include any HTML, CSS, and Javascript packaged in a zip file and loaded onto the device. It can also include local data such as tiles for interactive maps, like the Leaflet map below.
